# Product Discovery Framework - Detailed Reference

## Phase 1: Problem Discovery

**Understand the Problem**:
- What problem exists? (Be specific, not vague)
- Who experiences this problem? (Target user/audience)
- How do they currently handle it? (Current solution/workaround)
- What's the impact of the problem? (Cost, frustration, lost opportunity)
- Is this really the problem they're trying to solve?

**Discovery Questions**:
```
"Can you describe the last time you encountered this problem?"
"What did you try to do?"
"What happened?"
"How did that make you feel?"
"What would an ideal solution look like?"
```

**Red Flags (Problem not validated)**:
- ❌ No data, only assumptions
- ❌ Solving assumed problem, not real problem
- ❌ No user feedback collected
- ❌ Problem description is vague
- ❌ No clear target audience

## Phase 2: Research - Four Parallel Tracks

### **Track 1: User Research**

**User Discovery**:
- Who are the primary users?
- Who are secondary users?
- What are their goals/motivations?
- What are their pain points?
- How do they currently solve the problem?

**Interview Approach**:
- 5-8 user interviews (structured)
- Questions focused on behavior, not opinions
- Look for patterns across users
- Validate assumptions about the problem

**Output**:
- User personas (3-5 key personas)
- User journey maps
- Pain points prioritized
- Key insights documented

## Phase 3: Solution Exploration

**Define Solution Approach**:
- What's the proposed solution?
- Why this solution (vs alternatives)?
- What are key capabilities?
- What's our differentiation?
- What are constraints/trade-offs?

**Solution Validation**:
- Does solution address the problem?
- Are there unintended consequences?
- What could go wrong?
- What dependencies exist?
- Is scope realistic?

## Phase 4: Success Definition

**Define Success Criteria**:

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
- Adoption: % of target users adopted within X months
- Engagement: Usage frequency, feature adoption
- Retention: % of users retained after 90 days
- NPS: Net Promoter Score > X
- Revenue: Revenue per user, ARR impact
- Cost: CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), Cost per use

**Success Metrics** (Examples):
- User adoption: > 60% of target users active within Q1
- User satisfaction: NPS > 40, CSAT > 4/5
- Business impact: $X revenue within 12 months
- Market share: X% market penetration
- User feedback: Qualitative improvement in user feedback

**Success Timeline**:
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): MVP launch, early users
- Phase 2 (Months 2-3): Growth phase, feedback iteration
- Phase 3 (Months 4-6): Optimization, scale
- Phase 4 (6+ months): Mature product, optimization
