# Research Methodologies - Detailed Reference

## JTBD: Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

Every user is "hiring" a product to do a job:

```
User Context: [Situation]
Job to be done: [What they're trying to accomplish]
Struggling with: [Current obstacles]
Using today: [Current solution/workaround]
Desired outcome: [What success looks like]
```

Example:
```
Context: Starting a new tech project
Job: Understand what the market needs before building
Struggling with: How to validate ideas efficiently
Using today: Ad-hoc conversations, guesswork
Desired outcome: Confident product direction with real user validation
```

## 5 Whys Method (Find Root Cause)

```
Problem: Users don't adopt new feature
Why? → They don't know it exists
Why? → No in-app notification sent
Why? → Feature not fully released
Why? → Still in beta testing
Why? → Testing delays due to bugs

Root cause: Testing process delays
```

## SMART Goals (Measurable Success)

- **S**pecific: "Increase user adoption of dashboard"
- **M**easurable: "From 20% to 60% monthly active users"
- **A**chievable: "Within 3 months with current team"
- **R**elevant: "Improves user engagement by 40%"
- **T**ime-bound: "Q1 2026 launch"

## Impact vs Effort Matrix

```
High Impact, Low Effort → DO FIRST
High Impact, High Effort → PLAN CAREFULLY
Low Impact, Low Effort → NICE TO HAVE
Low Impact, High Effort → SKIP
```

## User Interview Techniques

### Open-Ended Questions (Get detailed answers):
- "Tell me about..."
- "How do you..."
- "What's your experience with..."
- "Why do you...?"

### Closed Questions (Get specific answers):
- "Do you use X?" (Yes/No)
- "On a scale of 1-10, how important is X?"
- "Which tool do you prefer?" (A, B, or C)

**Balance**: Mostly open (80%) with some closed (20%) for specificity

## Market Sizing: TAM/SAM/SOM

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**:
- Largest market opportunity
- All possible revenue in space
- Example: All enterprise software users = $100B TAM

**Serviceable Available Market (SAM)**:
- What we can realistically serve
- Our geographic + segment focus
- Example: Mid-market enterprises in US = $10B SAM

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**:
- What we can actually capture in phase 1
- Realistic market share goal
- Example: 1% market share = $100M SOM

## Competitive Analysis Matrix

| Competitor | Feature A | Feature B | Feature C | Price | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Company A] | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | $X | [Segment] |
| [Company B] | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | $X | [Segment] |
| [Us] | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | $X | [Segment] |

**Gaps Identified**:
- No one has all 3 features
- Price point opportunity at $X
- Target segment [Segment] underserved

## Research Quality Assessment

**Good Research** ✓:
- ✓ Problem validated with real user research (not assumptions)
- ✓ Data-driven (metrics, research, evidence)
- ✓ Clear target audience (specific, not "everyone")
- ✓ Market opportunity quantified (TAM, SAM, SOM)
- ✓ Competitive advantage identified
- ✓ Success metrics are measurable & achievable
- ✓ Technical feasibility assessed
- ✓ Business case compelling
- ✓ Assumptions documented & validated
- ✓ Ready for handoff to Product Manager

**Poor Research** ✗:
- ✗ Problem assumed, not validated with users
- ✗ No research conducted
- ✗ Target audience unclear ("anyone who...")
- ✗ Market opportunity guessed
- ✗ Success metrics vague ("more users", "better experience")
- ✗ No competitive analysis
- ✗ Assumptions not documented
- ✗ Not ready for PM/design handoff
- ✗ Missing key information
