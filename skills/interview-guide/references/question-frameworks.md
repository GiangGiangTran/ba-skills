# Question Frameworks - Detailed Reference

## Framework 1: 5 Whys (Find Root Cause)

**Purpose**: Dig deeper to find the real cause of problems

**Process**:
```
Question 1: "What problem do you face?"
→ User: "I can't track all my tasks"

Question 2: "Why is that difficult?"
→ User: "I use multiple tools"

Question 3: "Why do you use multiple tools?"
→ User: "Each tool does one thing well"

Question 4: "Why don't you consolidate?"
→ User: "No single tool has all features I need"

Question 5: "Why is that important?"
→ User: "Switching between tools costs time"

Root Cause: No unified tool exists for their workflow
```

**When to use**: When you want to understand the underlying problem

## Framework 2: Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

**Purpose**: Understand what "job" users are trying to accomplish

**Structure**:
```
Situation: [Context - when, where, why]
Job: [What they're trying to accomplish]
Struggling: [Current obstacles]
Using: [Current workaround/solution]
Desired Outcome: [What success looks like]
```

**Example Interview Flow**:
```
"Tell me about a time you needed to..."
→ Understand the situation

"What were you trying to accomplish?"
→ Identify the job

"What made it difficult?"
→ Find obstacles

"How did you solve it?"
→ Learn current approach

"What would make it easier?"
→ Understand desired outcome
```

**When to use**: Understanding user motivations and goals

## Framework 3: SMART Goal Setting

**Purpose**: Define measurable success for product/feature

**Structure**:
```
Specific: Clear definition of what we're solving
→ "Reduce time to complete X task"

Measurable: Quantifiable metric
→ "From 30 minutes to 10 minutes"

Achievable: Realistic with available resources
→ "Within 3 months of development"

Relevant: Matters to business and users
→ "Improves user satisfaction by 40%"

Time-bound: Clear deadline
→ "Launch by end of Q1 2026"
```

## Framework 4: Open vs Closed Questions

**Open Questions** (Get detailed answers):
- "Tell me about..."
- "How do you..."
- "What's your experience with..."
- "Why do you...?"

**Closed Questions** (Get specific answers):
- "Do you use X?" (Yes/No)
- "On a scale of 1-10, how important is X?"
- "Which tool do you prefer?" (A, B, or C)

**Balance**: Mostly open (80%) with some closed (20%) for specificity

## Interview Question Development

### Warm-up Questions (Build Rapport)

1. "What's your role/title?"
2. "How long have you been in this position?"
3. "What does a typical day look like?"
4. "How did you get into [field]?"

### Discovery Questions (Main Content)

Structure by theme:
```
Theme: [Topic Name]
Question 1: [Open question about topic]
  - Follow-up: "Tell me more..."
  - Follow-up: "Can you give an example?"

Theme: [Next topic]
Question 1: [Open question]
  - Follow-up: "How did that make you feel?"
```

### Validation Questions (Hypothesis Testing)

1. "How important is [feature/problem] to you?" (Scale 1-10)
2. "Would you use [proposed solution]?" (Yes/No/Maybe)
3. "What would make this more valuable?"

## Asking Follow-up Questions

### Probing Deeper

When participant gives short answer:
- "Can you tell me more?"
- "Can you give an example?"
- "Walk me through that..."
- "What happened next?"

### Clarifying Understanding

When you don't understand:
- "So what you're saying is...?"
- "Do you mean [X] or [Y]?"
- "Help me understand..."

### Exploring Emotions

When emotional reaction appears:
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What frustrated you most?"
- "What was exciting about that?"

## Interview Question Quality Checklist

✓ **Good Questions**:
- Open-ended (not yes/no)
- Ask about behavior (what they do, did)
- Ask about past experience ("Tell me about the last time...")
- Non-leading (not suggesting answer)
- Clear and concise
- Relevant to objectives

✗ **Bad Questions**:
- Leading: "Don't you think X would be better?"
- Hypothetical: "Would you ever...?" "Would you like to...?"
- Double questions: "Do you X or Y?"
- Vague: "What do you think?" (too broad)
- Long/complex sentences
