## Interview Best Practices

### DO ✓
- ✓ Ask open-ended questions
- ✓ Listen more (80%) than talk (20%)
- ✓ Ask follow-up: "Tell me more"
- ✓ Probe for specifics: "Can you give an example?"
- ✓ Ask about past behavior: "Tell me about the last time..."
- ✓ Thank them for their time
- ✓ Record (with permission) for accuracy
- ✓ Take notes during and after
- ✓ Look for patterns (after 5-8 interviews)

### DON'T ✗
- ✗ Ask leading questions: "Don't you think X would be better?"
- ✗ Pitch your solution: "We're building X, what do you think?"
- ✗ Interrupt or rush them
- ✗ Argue with their opinions
- ✗ Interview only people like you
- ✗ Ask hypothetical "Would you..." questions
- ✗ Talk more than user
- ✗ Forget to take notes
- ✗ Interview too few people (need 5-8 minimum)

## Red Flags During Interview

Watch for:
- Participant changes answer (believes they should say something)
- Long pauses (thinking hard - good - vs confusion - bad)
- Emotional reaction (tears, anger, excitement - note it!)
- Contradiction in answers (probe: "Earlier you said X, but...")

## Post-Interview Synthesis

### After 5-8 Interviews, Synthesize:

**Patterns** (What appears in 50%+ of interviews):
- Pattern: "Multiple users mentioned task switching friction"
- Evidence: User A said X, User C said Y, User G said Z
- Implication: This is a real, repeated problem

**Themes** (Main topics that emerged):
- Theme 1: Problem A (mentioned in 6/8 interviews)
- Theme 2: Problem B (mentioned in 4/8 interviews)
- Theme 3: Desired Feature C (mentioned in 5/8 interviews)

**Insights** (What this means):
- Insight 1: Users face X problem because of [root cause]
- Insight 2: Current solutions are [limited because...]
- Insight 3: Opportunity exists to [solve by...]

**Next Steps**:
- Create personas based on user types
- Build journey maps showing current workflow
- Define problem statement from interviews
- Test solution ideas with target users
