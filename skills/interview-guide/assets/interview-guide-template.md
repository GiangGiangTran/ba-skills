## Notes for Interviewer

### Interviewing Best Practices

**DO** ✓:
- Listen more (80%) than talk (20%)
- Use open-ended questions
- Ask follow-ups: "Tell me more" / "Can you give an example?"
- Ask about past behavior: "Tell me about the last time..."
- Pause for them to fill silence (don't rush)
- Write down key quotes
- Watch for emotions/tone

**DON'T** ✗:
- Ask leading questions: "Wouldn't you prefer X?"
- Interrupt them
- Pitch your solution
- Ask hypothetical "would you" questions
- Argue with their opinion
- Talk more than they do
- Skip the notes

### Red Flags

Watch for:
- [ ] Participant changes answer (believes they should say something)
- [ ] Long pauses (thinking hard - good - vs confusion - bad)
- [ ] Emotional reaction (tears, anger, excitement - note it!)
- [ ] Contradiction in answers (probe: "Earlier you said X, but...")

- [Sensitive topic 1]
