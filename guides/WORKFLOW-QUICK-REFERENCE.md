## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Document Everything**: v1 → v2 → v3 as you learn
2. **Get Stakeholder Feedback**: After each major phase
3. **Follow Sequentially**: Discovery → Analysis → Design → Risk
4. **Use Templates**: Reference assets/ directory for each skill
5. **Reference Previous Work**: Design uses Requirements, Risk uses Design
6. **Share Early & Often**: Team alignment prevents surprises
